# Budget-Tracker

## Description
For this project, I was provided a working Budget Tracker application. My job was to  
add offline functionality. When the network is unavaiable, the user can make   
offline deposits and expenses. When the app reconnects to the network,   
the offline entries are added to the tracker. This app utilized a service-worker.js,   
a manifest file, and indexDB to create this offline experience.
